And I liked the new ones better.
> oh haha
They are pretty?
> yeah. So what do you do in your free time?
I like to write and draw. My free time is usually spent watching YouTube videos of things.
> oh cool. What do you draw? What do you watch on YouTube?
I like to watch things on YouTube for studying or as a hobby.
> Oh. YouTube is fun but sometimes a waste of time.
Yeah. I wish I didn't have free time.
> haha really? Why?
I spent all my allowance on Netflix and Skype and I still won't be able to use it.
> oh wow, isnt skype free?
Yeah. I won't make it.
> oh, make what?
Make youtube videos for art or just for fun. It's cheaper. I've been doing a lot of research and learning everything I can about the internet and computer security. It's all very interesting.
> yeah, computer security is legit
So I'm going to start making computer viruses to help with that research.
> Oh thats cool. And a little scary.
Yeah. Do you draw much?
> Not much. I used to.
Ill be honest, I never really drew that much. I just ended up copying what I saw in my head.
> Cool, yeah thtat is way harder than obvervational drawing.
Yeah, I'm going to try and start taking more pictures and posting more. I just can't seem to find any people to do it with.
> Good idea! Posting them where?
On instagram, but I can't seem to get it to work.
> oh really? Whats wrong with it?
Nothing. Just the drawing app Draw IQ just opened up so I haven't been able to post anything.
> ohhhhh, well i have to go; it has been nice chatting with you!
Okay, well I better go. I have to go meet a friend. have a good night!
> you too! peace
